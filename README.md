# Test task Create a Django application using the Django Rest Framework, which is copying some of Instagram features - users(login/logout only), photos list, photo upload, stories list(implement only photos, read status required to filter only unread posts, also display only recent stories that created during last 24 hours), likes, and comments tree.
